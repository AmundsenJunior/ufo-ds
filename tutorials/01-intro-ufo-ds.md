#Do UFO sightings and drinking correlate? The Economist seems to think so.

>On July 2nd avid watchers of the skies celebrate World UFO day.The National UFO Reporting Centre, a non-profit, has catalogued almost 90,000 reported sightings of UFOs, mostly in America, since 1974. It turns out that aliens are considerate: they seldom disturb earthlings during working or sleeping hours. Rather, they tend to arrive in the evening, especially on Fridays, when folks are sitting on the front porch nursing their fourth beer.

Or perhaps there’s more to it.

What kind of lives do these Economist folks lead? They divide the American day into three sad segments of one spiraling pit of daily depression: working (8a-5p), drinking (5p-11p), and sleeping (11p-8a). If The Economist seems to think that drinking and UFO sightings significantly correlate (because why else publish this kind of analysis?), then why is it that Washington state, with the highest number of sightings per 100,000 people, isn’t a similarly high-ranking state in terms of alcohol use/abuse indicators?

See, I can grab stats from Google also.

The Economist chooses to conclude their analysis with the following:

>UFOs tend to shun big cities, where there are lots of other lights, and daylight hours, when people might think they were just aeroplanes.

First of all, I enjoy the level of agency The Economist ascribes to UFOs here; they “tend to shun” urban areas, as if the UFOs themselves  prefer making their cameo appearances in suburban neighborhoods and rural areas, ostensibly for their rustic charm. If they’re making this statement based on the UFO Center’s data, they certainly took an extremely casual bent in declaring to readers this conclusion.

Furthermore on that statement, I could just as easily claim that UFO sightings occur less frequently in cities, due to light pollution and large buildings obstructing much of the viewable sky. Similarly, there are less frequent sightings in the day because people may have their noses to the proverbial grindstones, too busy at work or school to be outside, necks craned, intently searching the heavens. Indeed, Economist-cum-Onion, how about:

>UFOs don’t show up in the daytime because there aren’t as many drunk amateur astronomers out and staggering about, awaiting the appearance of these super-intelligent grey beings, and eager to vomit their confirmations of the hyper-advanced flying saucers onto NUFORC.org.

Regardless of my nitpicking of individual claims, this isn’t good enough. Or more to the point, I bet there’s a better story in that data. The National UFO Reporting Center is a treasure trove of data, with nearly 90,000 sightings reported since 1974, along with historical data going back centuries. There are plenty of concerns that can and should be raised about a dataset full of self-reported information in the context of American UFO culture. But the Center does their own quality control and standardization on incoming reports, to a degree that it seems possible for quality data science to be rigorously applied. One could test numerous trends the data may contain, and certainly could go beyond The Economist’s dismissive alcohol argument, while still remaining skeptical of the factual validity of the data.

Full disclosure: I’m a believer. Had a sighting when I was six years old that, despite years of reflection, skepticism, and an ever-growing list of qualifying attributes with the encounter, I remain convinced of what I saw. But I’m also a budding programmer, and I want to learn how to do good data science. In recent years, I’ve come to understand, for myself at least, that learning needs motivating passion and curiosity behind the endeavor to be worthwhile; I don’t buy into doing programming exercises just for the sake of learning the tool. I learn by doing, and I learn by enjoying what I do. The exercises and sample data sets alone in Python for Data Analysis won’t engage my head enough to see the process through.

So today, on World UFO Day 2014, I’m starting my extended close encounter (for the first time) with data science. I’m not approaching this as a complete novice, but my Python and spatial analysis experience only brings me to this point feeling that I know little but want to learn so much. I’ll update here on my progress, providing what I experience as new insights and skills inasmuch as they are useful and transferable.
